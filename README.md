# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study 

This repository contains the Lead Scoring Case Study assignment from UpGrad.

## Problem Statement:

X Education, an education company offering online courses to industry professionals, attracts a large number of visitors to its website daily. These visitors, who may be interested in the courses, find the offerings through various marketing efforts on search engines like Google and other websites. When a visitor lands on the site, they might browse courses, fill out a form, or watch some videos. If they provide their contact information (email or phone number) via the form, they are classified as a lead. Additionally, the company also receives leads through referrals.

After acquiring leads, the sales team follows up with calls, emails, and other methods. However, only a small percentage of these leads convert, with the typical conversion rate at X Education being around 30%.

## Goal:

The primary goal is to identify the key features that contribute to predicting lead conversion. By generating a Lead Score for each lead, we aim to prioritize high-scoring leads for contact, ultimately improving the lead conversion rate.
